# 🏠 Interpretable Deep Neural Networks using SHAP and LIME for Decision Making in Smart Home Automation
# 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interpretable deep learning framework for smart home automation using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations).

A virtual smart home environment was designed using Tinkercad, where sensor readings were simulated and collected. These readings were stored in a CSV dataset and used to train Deep Neural Network (DNN) models for predicting smart home device states such as:

🚪 Door Status (Open / Closed)

🔔 Buzzer Status (ON / OFF)

💡 Bulb Status (ON / OFF)

🚶 Motion Detection (Motion / No Motion)

The project not only builds predictive models but also explains model decisions using Explainable AI techniques.

# 🏗 Smart Home Simulation (Tinkercad)
